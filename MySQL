##EXPLAIN THE CODE ABOVE

**CREATE DATABASE wordpress**; 
>> This makes a new database called wordpress. Think of it as a special storage space where WordPress will keep everything it needs.

**CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'a_strong_password_here';**
>> Adds a new MySQL user account named wordpressuser.
>> 'localhost' means this user can only log in from the same server where the database is hosted (your EC2 instance).
>> 'a_strong_password_here' is the password for that user (you should replace it with something strong and unique).

**GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';**
>> This grants the new user full control (create, read, update, delete) over all tables inside the wordpress database.

**FLUSH PRIVILEGES;**
>> MySQL stores privileges in memory. This command reloads them so the new user and permissions become active right away.
